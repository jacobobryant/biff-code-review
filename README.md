# Biff code review

If you're working on a [Biff](https://biffweb.com/) project and need help or would otherwise like some feedback on your code, [create an issue](https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff-code-review/issues/new). Include a link to the relevant files and/or commits in your project.

I (Jacob O'Bryant) will try to respond to all the feedback requests, and anyone else in the Biff community is also encouraged to respond if you have some time (especially if this becomes popular!). I mostly work on Biff on Fridays, so that's when I'll be most available for code review; but if I can answer a question quickly then I may do it throughout the week as well.
